          <p>About Me</p>
          <p>Technology Architecture Consultant & Software Developer</p>
          <!--p I am currently a Technical Architecture Delivery Consultant mainly focused in Salesforce and AI Chatbots. As my main interest is in Machine Learning and AI Ethics, I am also looking for Machine Learning Engineering & Data Science opportunities./p-->
          <p>I was born in South Korea and moved back and forth between Korea and Michigan, until in 2011, my family decided to settle in Michigan for good. Fast forward 8 years, I graduated from Michigan State University with a B.S. in Computer Science and Minor in Mathematics. </p>
          <p>After graduating, I moved to Chicago, Illinois to work as a Technical Architecture Delivery Analyst at Accenture. In the process, I stepped my feet into a wide spectrum of roles across different types of sectors/industries (Public Service, Sales Tech, Field Service Tech) and projects (Customer Service, Salesforce, ServiceMax, AI Chatbots). Currently, I am a chatbot experience design lead, which involves leading client calls to discuss/design content that the chatbot can provide, defect testing, and performing data analysis/reporting for chatbot performance metrics.</p>
          <p>In the future, I wish to utilize my software development skills that I acquired during my Undergraduate studies by transitioning into a more technical role in areas related to Big Data Analysis/Machine Learning/AI Ethics.</p>
          <p>During my free time, I enjoy taking long walks near Chicago rivers with some good music, visiting different cafes, and baking.<br><br><br> </p>
